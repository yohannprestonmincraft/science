    <h3>How can we seperate colours</h3>
    <p><b>Chromatography is a method for analyzing mixtures by separating them into the chemicals <br> from
         which they are made. It can be used to separate mixtures . In ink chromatography, you <br> are 
         separating the colored pigments that make up</b></p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Stationary phase</h3>
    <p><b>The phase over which the mobile phase passes in the technique of chromatography</b></p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Mobile phase</h3>
    <p><b>The liquid that flows through a chromatography system, moving the materials to be separated <br> at
         different rates over the stationary phase.</b></p>
